_My people in uniform are confidential_
I had a chance to serve my country. (2020 October - 2022 April) It was my honor to be there. I've made friends and learned responsibility and respect.

## What was your job?
I was a second generation telecommunication center manager. Basically, it is a vehicle-mounted router to the military intranet. It is vehicle mounted, therefore we could move with HQs beyond the frontline and relocate. Whenever there is an exercise in our area, we go there to support their connection between commanders and their units. It is my responsibility to build and maintain it 24/7. Basic knowledge of CCNA is useful.

## What have we learned?
Teamwork is the key to making things work. Trust is difficult to build and easy to break. Help everyone. Nothing is given. You have to earn your voice.
