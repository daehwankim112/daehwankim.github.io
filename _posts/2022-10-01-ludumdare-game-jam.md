# My First VR Game: LudumDare Game Jam 2022 

![Desktop View](/assets/images/yearbook/image5.png){: width="100%" }

I had a chance to participate in LudumDare Game Jam in 2022 Oct 1st, thanks to UVIC Game Development Club. I made my first working VR game on Unity 2019.3.8f1.

## What is Game Jam?

Game Jam is similar to a hackathon. The organizer announces the theme of the game jam at the begging of the event. This time, it was "Every 10 seconds". Participants need to build a game that fits into the theme in a limited amount of time, usually 72 hours.

## What is my game about?
```
"Every 10 seconds"
```

Thanks to the "Uvic Game Development Club", we had a chance to brainstorm about the theme "Every 10 seconds" before the game jam. It was a coincidence that our theme matched with the theme of Ludumdare. One of the interesting ideas we came up with was "submarine game with a sonar ping every 10 seconds to enable player to view the environment". I have altered that idea and came up with a VR zombie defence game. There is a rainstorm pouring down and a player can only view the zombies every 10 seconds when lighting hits the ground.

## Challenge

I have never made a game before. Furthermore, I have never done VR development. I only had some experience building VRChat avatars and worlds. I had to learn a lot in a short period of time. Furthermore, I had no experience with Blender and making assets from scratch except some fl studio experience. I was heavily dependent on unity asset store.

## What have I learned?

Unity is a well made engine for VR Game development. It seems like they are trying to expand their support for such a development environment. Valem posts tutorials of VR game development on Youtube. He also has a patroen tutorials.
