# 1st Place Government Technology Hackathon 2019 Nova Scotia

![Desktop View](/assets/images/yearbook/image4.png){: width=100% }

In 2019, I had a chance to participate in Government Technology Hackathon challenge at Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia, in collaboration with Ventureforcanada. This post is based on the previous post template "NASA Hackathon".

## What is a hackathon?

Hackathon is a problem solving challenge in limited time on various topics. For example, my team's challenge was in Digital Service section, which was

```
Improve recycling using technology.
```

## How did we fix the problem?

We have developed a system that uses recycled waste to build houses. This system is going to solve the recycling crisis caused by short demand, affordable housing, deforestation, concrete emissions and waste in housing. Recycled waste gets reframed into building material that could be 3D printed.

## What did I contribute?

We have developed a simulation of our system. The left side of the screen lets user draw a 2D blueprint of the building. The right side of the screen shows the building process of 3D printing based on the blueprint. User could select different structure type to select between wall and window. Click "Build" button to initiate the building process. Full screen link: https://editor.p5js.org/rlaeoghks112/full/qIkfj3_sx

## What have we learned?

This experience was different from NASA Spaceapps hackathon. We have learned that communication and team work is essential for the project to be carried out.
