# 1st Place NASA Spaceapps Challenge 2019 Nova Scotia

In 2019, I had a chance to participate in NASA International Spaceapps challenge in Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia. It was one of my greatest experience to have and recommend others to participate.

## What is hackathon?

Hackathon is a problem solving challenge in limited time on various topics. For example, my team's challenge was

```
Oceanic garbage patches are collections of marine debris that come together due to ocean currents; they have devastating effects on ocean ecosystems. Your challenge is to design a mission to help clean up garbage from the ocean!
```
